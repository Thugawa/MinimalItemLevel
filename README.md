# Minimal Item Level

A lightweight World of Warcraft Classic addon that displays **item level (ilvl)** on equipped gear slots in the Character Frame (C) and Inspect window.

Only shows ilvl — nothing else. No bags, no gems, no enchants, no upgrades, no average ilvl. Clean and minimal.

### Features
- Shows item level in **TOPRIGHT** corner of each equipped slot
- Colored by item quality (white → green → blue → purple → orange)
- Works perfectly on **your character** (Paperdoll) and **inspected players**
- Uses custom font **Expressway.ttf** (included in Fonts folder)
- Extremely lightweight (~1 KB of code)
- Fully compatible with ElvUI (skinned or vanilla), and most other addons
- No configuration menu — just install and go


### Custom Font
The addon uses **Expressway.ttf** located in:
MinimalItemLevel\Fonts\Expressway.ttf


### License
MIT License – feel free to fork, modify, and use however you want.

Made with love for the Classic community.  
Enjoy! 🚀
